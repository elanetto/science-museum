            <h1>Electricity</h1>
            <p>Electricity is where modern technology is grounded. It is what gives us light, warmth, the internet, screens and cars.
                It is hard to picture a modern society without electricity - what and where would we even be without it?
            </p>
            <p>Electricity is - as we see it - the start and SPARK of modern technology.</p>
            <p>To better understand the innovative technology and creativity of the last 100 years, where therefore need to understand what electricity is - and how to use it.</p>
            <p>In our exhibits, you will be able to learn, explore and experience what electricity really is.</p>
            <p>Are you ready to get SHOCKED?!</p>

                    <h2>The origins of Electricity</h2>
                    <p>Explore the origins of electricity!</p>
                    <p>Back in 1752, Benjamin Franklin took a kite with a key to the skies during a thunder storm. Or, at least, that is what we think happened.</p>
                    <p>Electricity has always been here - especially in the form of lightning - 
                        but there is only in the last 100 years that we have effectively been able to use it in our everyday lives.</p>
                    <p>Explore the different ways we can create, store and then use electricity today, with our different exhibitions at the museum.</p>

                        Make electricity with the power of your body, and then use that to power up appliances at our exhibitions. We have several exhibitions at the museum where you can play, explore and challenge each other to be the most effective wielder and maker of electricity.

                    <h2>The Power Plant</h2>
                    <p>In Norway, approximately 96% of all power used comes from renewable hydropower.
                        Our country is not only next to the stormy sea, but we also have mountains and fjords with
                        damns and waterfalls that we use to generate our power.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, how do we store, distribute and use this power?</p>
                    <p>
                        At The Power Plant exhibit, you get to be the CEO of a Hydro Power-plant. You will need to make the best and most effective choices in when to store, when to use, and how to distribute our hydropower throughout the country - and beyond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What kind of CEO will you be - when you are the one behind the steering wheel?

                    <h2>The power of lightning</h2>
                    <p>
                        There is a reason why yielding lightning is one of the most powerful strengths in myths and in books. Thor with his hammer, or Jack and the Lightning Thief - lightning is both terrifying, unhinged, deadly and powerful.

                        Take part in the lightning-room, and use VR-technology to be a lightning wielder. Experience the crazy power and strength of electricity.
