            <h1>Technology</h1>
            <p>Modern technology, as we know it - is still new. You might have grown up
                with it at your fingertips, and it might seem like it has always been there - 
                but only a few decades ago, life was quite different.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we talk about technology at The Science Museum - we are specifically talking about modern technology from tha last 100 years. So much has happened in only a few lifetimes, that it would be almost unthinkable for someone in the 15th century How fast evolution, innovation and technology has grown in our century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Explore our exhibits about modern technology to better understand where we came from, how we got here - and where we are going.
            </p>
            <p>Maybe YOU are the key to tomorrows technology?</p>

                    <h2>Technology & Coding</h2>
                    <p>Learn how we use code to make technology work. Coding is an integral part in
                        how we communicate to computes - to tell the computer what we want the computer to do.
                        It is in many ways simply different languages for different technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>Join in on our MicroBit workshops, coding-classes and more.</p>
                    <p>Coding is a huge part of modern technology today.</p>

                    <p>
                        The Wright Brothers created their first airborne airplane in 1903. They were perceived as crazy in their time, because they believed that they could fly. Guess who's laughing now?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At The Science Museum we have several flight simulator experiences - from the first airplanes to the latest ones. Would you like to try to fly, or at least experience what it would feel like?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Try our airplane simulators at the Technology exhibitions!

                    <p>What technoloy is used in a modern city? Have you ever thought about how many things that
                        needs to just WORK in order for a ciry to function? And have you ever thought about how 
                        rooted modern cities are in technology and electricity?
                    </p>
                    <p>Use the buttons to simulate the miniature city. Make the trains go at the right time, 
                        give the hosbitals, schools and offices enough electricity, give everyone enough water and do NOT forget about the trash..</p>
                    <p>Explore how a city is able to run smoothly (or not) in our miniature city exibition at the museum.</p>

                    <p>Learn about the design innovations throughout the years, and try out some of this older tech for yourself. 
                        Your grandmother might have worked on a huge computer with a floppy disc in the 80s: What does that even look like, and could you make it work yourself? </p>
                    <p>Learn about one's and zero's in coding, and how technology gives us the posibility to save files on a disk. Are the files saved forever?</p>
