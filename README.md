# CA Project Methodology Summary:
The Project Methodology Class introduces the Semester Project, a significant task for year 1 FrontEnd Development students, involving planning with tools like Trello or GitHub Projects. It marks their first experience with such detailed planning. 

The project entails creating a website for a local Science Museum catering to ages 7-15. Recognizing that coolness is vital for youngsters, the goal is to craft a site deemed cool by the target audience. The primary focus is on elementary and middle school students, with a secondary audience of parents and teachers. 

The website aims to attract youths, schools, and parents to the Science Museum by providing essential information, including address, opening hours, and booking details, along with engaging content such as exhibitions and events. 

Coding requirements emphasize responsiveness, fast-loading images, WCAG compliance, SEO, and semantic code for accessibility. The site's optimization considerations encompass color-blindness, readable text, and adherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
